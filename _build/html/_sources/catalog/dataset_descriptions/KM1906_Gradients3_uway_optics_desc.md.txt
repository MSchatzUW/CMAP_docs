Underway (~ 7m) optical measurements on KM1906. LISST data processed using spherical kernel inversion and corrected for background particle concentrations as in White et al (2015) JGR. Volume to carbon concentrations obtained using Menden-Deuer and Lassard 2000 equation for non-diatom protists. Processing ECOTRIPLET: filtered values (<0.2 um) removed from chl and volume scattering data; chl fluorescence converted to mg/m3 using factory calibrations. Processing AC-S: filtered values (<0.2 um) removed from all data (see White et al., 2017, GRL); data corrected for residual temperature and scattering; AC-S chl concentrations obtained from a Gaussian fit over absorbance spectra in the red portion of the spectrum, assuming in vivo chl-a specific absorption of 0.0203 m2/mg at 674 nm .
