The reprocessed altimetry dataset in CMAP was provided by CMEMS. It is a
1/4° daily global gridded satellite product of sea level altimetry and
derived variables (sla,adt,vgos,vgosa,ugos,ugosa). The creation of this
dataset was possible by taking data from multiple altimetry missions and
homogenizing them with the same processing techniques, models and
geophysical corrections. The OSTM/Jason-2 mission was used as a
reference dataset, with accompanying data from Jason-3, Sentinel-3A,
HY-2A, Saral/AltiKa, Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-1, T/P, ENVISAT, GFO and
ERS1/2.

A more detailed description of the processing techniques can be found
[here](http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_047).
Quality control and sources of error are described in detail
in the CMEMS [Sea Level Quality Information Document](http://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-SL-QUID-008-032-062.pdf).
In summary, the
source of error partially depends on the number of satellites per
observation. QA checks of the gridded product are done by comparing
measurements against in-situ tide gauge readings. With only two
altimeters overhead, SLA errors in the low variability areas such as the
open ocean can reach 1.4 cm², while the error in high variability areas
reaching up to 37.7 cm². Errors within coastal areas (defined as within
200 km of land), are typically 8.2 cm².

The CMEMS internal name for this dataset is:
**SEALEVEL\_GLO\_PHY\_L4\_REP\_OBSERVATIONS\_008\_047**.
