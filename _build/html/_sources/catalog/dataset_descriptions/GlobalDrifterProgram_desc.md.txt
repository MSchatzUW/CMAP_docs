The Global Drifter Program is a multi-decadal oceanography survey of sea surface temperature and ocean current data taken from a network of autonomous drifting floats. The dataset spans a 40-year time range with coverage of the global ocean. Each drifter records SST and speed along with zonal and meridional components of velocity. Uncertainty values in sst and velocity components are also included. Each drifter is comprised of a surface buoy attached to a sub-surface float or 'drogue'. The drogue ensures that surface currents, rather than wind drive the buoy's direction.

CMAP contains over 37 million records and 24,000 unique drifter ID's from this project. Each drifter relays data every six hours via satellite. Data was acquired via the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Atlantic Oceanography and Meteorological Laboratory's FTP site. The specific datasets ingested into CMAP are: buoydata_1_5000.dat.gz, buoydata_5001_10000.dat.gz, buoydata_10001_15000.dat.gz,buoydata_15001_jun19.dat.gz
