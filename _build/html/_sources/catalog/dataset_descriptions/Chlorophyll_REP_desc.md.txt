The **Chlorophyll\_REP** dataset in CMAP is a global 25km X 25km 8 day
averaged product, with a temporal coverage from 1998-01-01 through
2018-06-26. This product is a satellite derived chl\_a estimate for the
global ocean, provided by the Ocean Colour Thematic Center at the
Copernicus Marine environment monitoring service ([CMEMS](http://marine.copernicus.eu/)) The dataset
is generated from ESA and NASA satellite missions, specifically from
SeaWiFS, MODIS-Squa, MERIS, VIIRSN and OLCI-S3A. This level 4 dataset
was created by linking multiple satellite ocean color observations into
a gridded space-time interpolated cloud free dataset. In-situ and
multi-mission validation and QA details can be found on page 15 of the
Ocean Colour Production Center [Quality Information Document](http://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-OC-QUID-009-030-032-033-037-081-082-083-085-086-098.pdf).

In 2018, CMEMES adopted a re-processing of SeaWifs, MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS-N
data. In addition to this, the chlorophyll retrieval algorithm was
switched to the Hu/CI algorithm for oligotrophic waters and the OC5
algorithm for coastal areas. These algorithmic changes not only improve
chlorophyll detection rates, but also bring CMEMS inline with other NASA
Ocean Color product processing techniques. Details on the ocean color
algorithms can be found [here](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/chlor_a/).

The CMEMS internal name for this dataset is:
OCEANCOLOUR\_GLO\_CHL\_L4\_REP\_OBSERVATIONS\_009\_082.
