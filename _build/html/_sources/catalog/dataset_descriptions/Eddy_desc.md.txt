Simons CMAP contains **Eddy** records from 1993-01-01 through 2018-01-18
collected from AVISO+. The dataset was developed and validated in
collaboration between Aviso+ and with D.Chelton and M. Schlax at Oregon
State University. This dataset has a spatial resolution of 1/4° X 1/4°
and a daily temporal resolution. Each eddy has associated
(cyclonic/anticyclonic), speed, radius metadata.

To detect eddies, this datasets uses ADT and SLA measurements from
multiple altimetry satellite missions. Eddy's that may come within
proximity to land are filtered out. Details on the detection algorithm
can be found in [\[Schlax & Chelton, 2016\]](http://wombat.coas.oregonstate.edu/eddies/Growing_Method_of_Eddy_Identification_and_Tracking.pdf). More details on
detection, filtering and processing can be found in the [Eddy Trajectory
Atlas Product Handbook](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/fileadmin/documents/data/tools/hdbk_eddytrajectory_META2018.pdf).

The AVISO+ product name is: Merged delayed-time version 2.0exp
