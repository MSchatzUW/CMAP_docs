Mesoscale eddies shape the temporal and spatial variability of ecosystem processes in many regions of the World Ocean, but an exhaustive description of their influence on the plankton community is still missing, partly due to the complex physical-biological interaction taking place inside the eddies. HOE-Legacy 4 was an oceanographic cruise organized by the Simons Collaboration on Ocean Processes and Ecology (SCOPE) and the Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE) in 2016. The cruise took place in the northeast sector of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre during May 9-14 2016 onboard the research vessel Kaimikai-o-Kanaloa, leaving from and returning to the port of Honolulu.   HOE-Legacy 4 was one of a series of cruises investigating the biogeochemical and ecological variability associated with mesoscale eddies, that are regions of the ocean with diameters of tens to hundreds of kilometers characterized by a rotational motion.
