Underway (~ 7m) optical measurements on MGL1704.  LISST data processed using spherical kernel inversion and corrected for background particle concentrations as in White et al (2015) JGR. Volume to carbon concentrations obtained using Menden-Deuer and Lassard 2000 equation for non-diatom protists. Ecotriplet data corrected for dissolved signal (0.2 um filter), see White et al. (2017), GRL. Processing ECOTRIPLET: filtered values (<0.2 um) removed from chl and volume scattering data; chl fluorescence converted to mg/m3 using factory calibrations.
