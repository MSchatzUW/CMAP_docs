The objective of the cruise was to deploy and follow free-drifting surface drifters in the vicinity of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) station (Station ALOHA; defined as a circle with a 6 nautical mile radius centered at 22° 45N, 158°W). The overall goal was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the diel patterns in phytoplankton physiology and biogeochemical cycling in near-surface waters of the oligotrophic North Pacific Ocean.  Such diel patterns in ecology are particularly relevant in biological oceanographic research where the planktonic biomass turns over on timescales of days.
