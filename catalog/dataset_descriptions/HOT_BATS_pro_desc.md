Five year time-series containing Prochlorococcus ecotype abundance sampled each month at HOT and BATS sites from 2002-2008 The goal of this study was to collect long-term, high-resolution data on the temporal and spatial variability of Prochlorococcus ecotypes in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The abundance of five Prochlorococcus ecotypes was determined by quantitative PCR at 12 depths every month for 5 years at two locations: BATS location (5 nautical mile radius around 31 40'N, 64 10'W) HOT Station ALOHA (5 nautical mile radius around 22 45'N, 158 00' W) Sample processing and analyses are detailed in the publication listed below. Briefly, 100ml of seawater was collected onto 25mm dia polycarbonate filters (0.22um pore size), rinsed with Tris-buffered saline, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80C until extraction. DNA was extracted using a combination of 5min of bead beating and 15min heat lysis at 95C. Extracted DNA was used as template of quantitative PCR reactions using primers specifically designed to target different Prochlorococcus ecotypes. Standard curves used for quantitation of field data were derived from DNA extracted from cultured representatives belonging to each ecotype.
