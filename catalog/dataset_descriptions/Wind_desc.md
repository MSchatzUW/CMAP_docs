The Near-Real-Time Wind dataset in CMAP is provided by CMEMS. This
IFREMER CERSAT Global Blended Mean Wind Fields dataset provides global
1/4Â° coverage and blended wind measurements in six-hour time intervals.
Data is split into zonal, meridional and combined wind stress and wind
speed values. The end data is created using a blend of satellite
radiometers and scatterometers from ASCAT-A, ASCAT-B, Coriolis and four
Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) satellites.

The IFREMER CERSAT Global Blended Mean Wind Fields include wind
components (meridional and zonal), wind module, wind stress. The
associated error estimates are also provided. They are estimated from
scatterometers ASCAT and OSCAT retrievals and from ECMWF operational
wind analysis with a horizontal resolution of 0.25x0.25 degrees and 6
hours in time, and available at synoptic time 00h:00; 06h:00; 12h:00;
18h:00. NRT products are released from CMEMS with a 24-48 hour delay.

The CMEMS internal name for this dataset is:
**WIND\_GLO\_WIND\_L4\_NRT\_OBSERVATIONS\_012\_004**.
