LISST underway (~ 7m) optical measurements on KOK1606, processed using spherical kernel inversion and corrected for background particle concentrations as in White et al (2015) GRL. Volume to carbon concentrations obtained using Menden-Deuer and Lassard 2000 equation for non-diatom protists. Generated by Prof. Dr. Angelicque A. White, University of Hawaii, aewhite@hawaii.edu
