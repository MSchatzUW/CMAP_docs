The MODIS PAR dataset in CMAP is satellite derived, 8-day averaged product with a spatial resolution of 9km. PAR is calculated using the 469,555 and 645 bands of the MODIS Aqua satellite. PAR is in units of Einsteins [m⁻² d⁻¹].  Details on the PAR processing algorithm can be found at: https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/technical/seawifs_reports/postlaunch/PLVol22.pdf
This dataset is provided by the Ocean Biology Processing Group at NASA GSFC.

**L3m_8D_PAR_par_9km** is the original naming convention for this dataset.
