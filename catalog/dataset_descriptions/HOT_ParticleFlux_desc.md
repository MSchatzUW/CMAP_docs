Particle flux was measured at a standard reference depth of 150 m using multiple cylindrical particle interceptor traps deployed on a free-floating array for approximately 60 h during each cruise. Sediment trap design and collection methods are described in Winn et al. (1991). Samples were analyzed for particulate C, N, P & Si. Typically six traps are analyzed for PC and PN, three for PP, and another three traps for PSi.
