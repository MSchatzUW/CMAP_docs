The Sea Surface Temperature dataset in CMAP is the **GHRSST Level 4
AVHRR\_OI Global Blended Sea Surface Temperature Analysis (GDS version
2) from NCEI**. This data product has a 1/4° X 1/4° degree gridded
spatial resolution with global ocean coverage at a 1 day temporal
interval. The dataset is derived from a combination of multiple AVHRR
(Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) satellites along with in-situ
sst measurements from ship and buoy measurements. These data sources are
optimally interpolated to produce a complete smoothed grid.

The PODAAC JPL NASA short name for this dataset is:
**AVHRR\_OI-NCEI-L4-GLOB-v2.0**.
