The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey dataset is a multi-decadal study to categorize plankton across the global oceans. The first CPR survey begun in 1931, but standardized sampling and analysis methods took hold in 1948. While the survey has a wide geographical coverage, it is highly biased to North Atlantic cruises. The CPR instrument is designed to be towed behind ships at a depth ~5-10 meters. Water passes through an inlet at the front of instrument and flows over rotating ~270Î¼m silk mesh designed to capture plankton. This screen is then covered with another mesh and then rolled and stored in Formalin for preservation. The CPR Zooplankton dataset (v4.1) in CMAP ranges from 1946 to the end of 2016. The dataset contains spatial coordinates and collection time stamps. At each temporal coordinate, any identified species are listed by taxonID, scientificNameID and scientific name. Other details such as Taxon Remarks and Catalog Numbers are also included.
