The near-real-time altimetry dataset in CMAP was provided by CMEMS. It
is a 1/4° daily global gridded satellite product of sea level altimetry
and derived variables (sla,adt,vgos,vgosa,ugos,ugosa). Sea Level Anomaly
(SLA) measurements were calculated with respect to a twenty year average
from 2012. Altimeter satellite gridded Sea Level Anomalies (SLA)
computed with respect to a twenty-year 2012 mean. The SLA is estimated
by from the along-track Level 3 altimetry product and then Optimal
Interpolated to produce a near-real-time altimetry products

A more detailed description of the processing techniques can be found
[here](http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_NRT_OBSERVATIONS_008_046). Quality control and sources of error are described in detail
in the CMEMS [Sea Level Quality Information Document](http://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/documents/QUID/CMEMS-SL-QUID-008-032-062.pdf). In summary, the
source of error partially depends on the number of satellites per
observation. QA checks of the gridded product are done by comparing
measurements against in-situ tide gauge readings. With only two
altimeters overhead, SLA errors in the low variability areas such as the
open ocean can reach 1.4 cm², while the error in high variability areas
reaching up to 37.7 cm². Errors within coastal areas (defined as within
200 km of land), are typically 8.2 cm².

The CMEMS internal name for this dataset is:
**SEALEVEL\_GLO\_PHY\_L4\_NRT\_OBSERVATIONS\_008\_046**.
