Water samples of 50 ml (nanoplankton) and 300-500 ml (microplankton) are taken at each of 8 depths in the euphotic zone (surface to 175 m) from the same CTD profiles (and bottles) that sample the microbial community by HPLC pigments and flow cytometry. The 50-ml samples are preserved with 2-ml of 10% paraformaldehyde and stained with proflavin (0.33% w/v). The larger samples are preserved with 300 µl of alkaline Lugols solution followed by 10 ml of buffered formalin and 500 µl of sodium thiosulfate (modified protocol from Sherr and Sherr, 1993); and then stained with proflavin (0.33% w/v). Preserved samples are slowly (~5 psi) filtered onto either black 0.8-µm (50 ml) or 8.0-µm (300-500 ml) Nuclepore filters overlaying 20-µm Millipore backing filters to facilitate even cell distributions. During filtration, the samples are drawn down until approximately 1-2 ml remain in the filtration tower. Concentrated DAPI (50 mg ml-1) is added and allowed to sit briefly before filtering the remainder of the sample until dry. Filters are mounted onto glass slides with immersion oil and cover slips. Prepared slides are placed in a dark box and kept frozen at -80 C until analysis.
