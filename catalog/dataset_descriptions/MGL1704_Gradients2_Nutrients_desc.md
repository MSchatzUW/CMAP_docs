All organic and inorganic nutrients are analyzed in unflitered seawater that was sampled aboard into HDPE or polypropylene bottles and immediately frozen. Silicate, phosphate and nitrate+nitrite are determined colormetrically on a SEAL Analytical Autoanalyzer (AA3 with HR detectors), with the exception of nitrate+nitrite that is <0.5umol/L, which is analyzed by chemiluminescence. Total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) are determined by analysis of phosphate and nitrate, respectively, after oxidation by high-intensity ultraviolet light. Total organic phosphorus and total organic nitrogen are determined by subtracting background PO4 and NO3+NO2 from TP and TN, respectively. Total organic carbon is determined by combustion on a Shimadzu TOC-V analyzer.
