These datasets are from the MESO-SCOPE cruise conducted in July/August 2017.   The aim was to dentify the impact of mesoscale eddies on the ecosystem of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Samples were collected daily and from two large-volume deckboard incubation experiments.  Metatranscriptomes of large eukaryotes (>5Âµm) were sequenced, and used to determine patterns in transcript abundance.
