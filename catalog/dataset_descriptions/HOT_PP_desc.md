Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. All incubations from 1990 through mid-2000 were conducted in situ at eight depths (5, 25, 45, 75, 100, 125, 150 and 175m) over one daylight period using a free-drifting array as described by Winn et al. (1991). Starting HOT-119 (October 2000), we collected samples from only the upper six depths & modeled the lower two depths based on the monthly climatology. During 2015, all incubations were conducted in situ on a free floating, surface tethered array. Integrated carbon assimilation rates were calculated using the trapezoid rule with the shallowest value extended to 0 meters and the deepest extrapolated to a value of zero at 200 meters.
