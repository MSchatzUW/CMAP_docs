Water samples for dissolved gases were collected in duplicate from Niskin bottles and fixed with mercuric chrolide saturated solution. Samples were stored at room temperature in the dark until analysis in the laboratory by purge and trap gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector for CH4 and an electron capture detector for N2O. A complete description of the methodology can be found in Wilson et al.(2017)
