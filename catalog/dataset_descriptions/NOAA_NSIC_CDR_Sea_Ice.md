The NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record Sea Ice dataset is a 35+ year satellite composite of
sea ice concentration for the Arctic and Antarctic.
The CDR has daily temporal resolution with a spatial resolution of 25 km X 25km.
It is compiled from the satellite missions: Nimbus-7, DMSP-F8, DMSP-F11, DMSP-F13 and DMSP-F17.
The daily data product contains four sea ice concentration estimates along with standard deviation and QA flags.
Valid sea ice concentration values range from 0 to 1.

Details on data processing and QA flags can be found via the NSIDC: https://nsidc.org/data/g02202

The NSIDC/NOAA internal name for this dataset is: **NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record of Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration, Version 3 - Data Set ID:G02202**
