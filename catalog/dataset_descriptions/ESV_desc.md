This dataset consists of relative microbial abundances (primarily Bacteria/Archaea) sampled across a latitudinal transect of the Atlantic ocean. Samples were collected between April - May 2012 on the cruise ANT28-5 (R/V Polarstern) by the research groups of Irene Wagner-Döbler (Technische Universität Braunschweig) and Meinhard Simon (Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg). At each oceanographic station, multiple depths were sampled primarily in the photic zone (≤ 200 m), and each sample was sequentially filtered to obtain three size fractions:

  1. Free-living (0.2 - 3 μm; FL)
  2. Small particle associated (3 - 8 μm; SPA)
  3. Large particle associated (> 8 μm; LPA)

Detailed methods are available in three previously-published papers that discuss large-scale patterns in microbial diversity, co-occurrence, and biogeography across this transect (Milici et al., 2016a, b, c).
