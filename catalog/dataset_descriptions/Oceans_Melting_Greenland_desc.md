The Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) is a NASA/JPL mission to study the how ocean warming is affecting the Greenland Ice Sheet. OMG is a 5-year mission that begun in 2016. Each spring airborne campaigns measure Greenlands outlet glaciers using radar. In the summer, the airborne campaign drops ~250 expendable CTDs (AXCTD), which measure ocean temperature, salinity, conductivity, sound velocity and density as they sink. Simons CMAP contains AXCTD depth profiles from 2016-09-13 to 2018-09-11.
